			<h1>About</h1>
			<h3 style="padding-top:1%;padding-bottom:1%;">I am a recent graduate from the University of Bristol with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Electronics.</h3>
			<p>
				Having been interested in computers for as long as I can remember, I was drawn to learning more about computers. From making basic games with Scratch during primary school IT class, to learning Python for my GCSEs, and to more advanced programming concepts during university, computers and programming have become integral to my identity.
			</p>
			<p>
				A massive part of what drew me to computing came from games, and delving into game development has been invaluable in diversifying my skillset. Not only did I develop an understanding for the complex logic supporting the systems that I took for granted when playing, I learnt about the considerations needed to provide a fun interactive experience. Working in Unity and C#, I have made small personal projects and participated in game jams, taking upon the task of creating a game under a strict deadline.
			</p>
			<p>
				Apart from programming, I enjoy playing the board game Go. My continued practice has improved skills like problem-solving and big-picture strategic thinking. The intuition required for good moves at the start while the game is a blank canvas, combined with the logical decision-making as the game progresses and positions solidify makes the game interesting.
