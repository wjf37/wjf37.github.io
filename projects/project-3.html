			<p>
				This website was made with only HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript as an exercise to build the website from the ground up. It also meant that I could use GitHub pages to host the website for free.
			</p>
			<p>
				I intended to make a website that would look and feel modern, but be very lightweight and responsive. This meant that for media like the images and "GIFs" shown in the other pages I opted for the webP format is it allowed for a smaller file size while retaining much more quality as compared to other formats like PNG or GIF.
			</p>
			<p>
				HTML was used to set the layout and the content of the website, and then used CSS to apply a modern look and feel by making the website reactive to the user's interactions. Javascript was used to reduce the amount of reused code for components like the navigation bar, the Contact area, and the project cards. The filter buttons also used JavaScript to show and hide projects of specific categories.
