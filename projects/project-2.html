			<p>
                This game was developed as part of the "Mini Jame Gam #27" game jam hosted on itch.io. The game was developed in 2 days, with the theme of "Back to the Beginning", and requiring a computer to act as a special object.
				I called it return to 5000BC as the game is set around going back to the beginning of civilisation.
			</p>
            <p>
                Developed in Unity and C#, this was a top-down 2D game focused on collecting resources. The game is set during the Neolithic period, where the protagonist has been sent back in time with just their laptop, 
				and must collect resources to survive and to compile what information they can from the laptop before the battery runs out. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the game the player must collect nearby resources and navigate back to the cave, making sure not to get lost. The game's ending screen would change to reflect the player's success or failure in collecting 
				resources in time. In order to make each replay challenging, the resources spawn randomly.
            </p>
